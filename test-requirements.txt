# Add dependencies that are required to test your package.  These
# will be installed when ``setup.py test`` is run.  They will also
# be installed into the test environment generated by Travis CI.
# Development tools that are not absolutely required for testing
# should be placed into dev-requirements.txt
#
# Unless otherwise noted, we expect that the dependencies
# follow semantic versioning, and will loosely pin them to
# minimize breakage to our dev environment.
